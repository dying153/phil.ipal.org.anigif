This is the first beta if the ANGIF library.  This is a rough cut beta
which has not been fully tested.  I've used some of it but not all of
it, so beware.  There is very little documentation.  The function calls
are described in the source code as comments.

ANGIF features:

*   LZW-free!  It contains no code implementing the patended LZW algorithm.

*   Supports GIF animation via a sequence of calls for each frame or portion
    of a frame in the animation sequence.

*   Supports true-color 24-bit images by means of multiple image blocks.
    A recursive "divide and conquer" algorithm is used to divide up the
    image into a block contains no more than 256 colors.

ANGIF is not A graphics composing tool.  Consider using tools from Tom
Boutell's GD library to The GIMP for a range from low level programming
to high level interactive in building images.

In order to avoid being mistaken for spam, be sure to put "ANGIF:" at the
beginning of your subject.  I will be taking bug reports and hope to release
fixed versions in the future.  However, I will not be doing free support.
You've got the source code.

There is no "configure".  Perhaps some day I will autoconf this package.
But then, perhaps not.  GIF should slowly die, and ANGIF may not have
much of a life as a result.

The provided Makefile assumes the compiler and loader is gcc and that
a shared library is to be built.  Just type "make" to compile and build
the library.  Type "make install" to install it.  Things are installed
wherever the symlinks "Install_bin", "Install_inc", and "Install_lib"
point to.

The "pnmtogif" program needs the PBM (Portable Bit Map) library.  If
you don't have it, you can't use "pnmtogif".  If you did a full install
of a recent version of Red Hat Linux you have PBM.  Other distributions
of Linux and other Unix systems may also have it.

In order to avoid being mistaken for spam, be sure to put "ANGIF:" at the
beginning of your subject.  I will be taking bug reports and hope to release
fixed versions in the future.  However, I will not be doing free support.
You've got the source code.
